        <h1>Return / Refund and Exchange Policy</h1>
        <p>Trick Storee is committed to ensuring customer satisfaction. Please read the following policy to understand our guidelines regarding returns, refunds, and replacements for both physical and digital products.</p>
        
        <h2>For Physical Products</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eligibility for Returns:</strong> We accept returns within 3 days of delivery for any reason, including issues beyond faulty products. Returns must be initiated within 3 days by contacting us at <a href="/contactus">contact us</a> (include order number, reason, and any supporting proof) or by opening a ticket on our website. The customer is responsible for shipping the item to our warehouse address, which will be provided upon approval of the return request.</li>
            <li>Returns based on “change of mind” are not accepted. The item must be in unworn condition and returned with complete original packaging, exactly as delivered. If any part of the product or packaging is missing, or if fraudulent activity is suspected, Trick Storee reserves the right to cancel the refund or deduct a penalty from the refund amount.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Faulty Product Claims</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Trick Storee provides a 3-day check warranty on physical products. If the product is found to be faulty within this period, we will issue a full refund, including the 250 PKR confirmation charge for Cash on Delivery orders.</li>
            <li>If a faulty product claim is found to be inaccurate after inspection, a penalty may be applied to the refund amount to cover processing costs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Return Shipping Costs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The customer is responsible for covering shipping costs when returning non-faulty products. Shipping charges initially paid by the customer for delivery are non-refundable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Refund Process</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Upon receiving the returned item, we will inspect the product and respond accordingly. For valid returns, refunds will be processed via online transfer to the customer’s bank account or wallet payment app. We will request necessary bank details from the customer after the product has been received and verified.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Non-Returnable Items</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>For hygiene and safety reasons, certain personal care products or specific items may not be eligible for returns. These items will be clearly marked on our website.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>For Digital Products</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Refund Eligibility:</strong> Refunds for digital products are only offered if the product is faulty and we are unable to resolve the issue. Trick Storee provides active client support, allowing users to contact us at any time for issue resolution.</li>
            <li>Once a digital product is accessed or downloaded, refunds will not be provided except in the case of unresolved faults.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Replacement Policy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We aim to resolve any issues with digital products by providing support or a replacement rather than a refund. Customers experiencing issues should contact our support team via <a href="/contactus">contact us</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Policy Violations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Digital products are strictly for personal use. If we find evidence of the customer violating our terms (e.g., sharing or reselling digital content), we reserve the right to revoke access, limit client support, or restrict usage without issuing a refund.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Exchange Policy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eligibility for Exchanges:</strong> Customers may request exchanges within 5 working days of delivery for faulty products, wrong sizes, or incorrect items received. Exchanges must be initiated by contacting us at <a href="/contactus">contact us</a> or by opening a ticket on our website.</li>
            <li>If the customer wants to exchange an item for a different color or size, they will need to return the original item to us. If we are responsible for sending the wrong item, we will arrange for the correct item to be delivered, and the customer will only need to return the incorrect item to the delivery person.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Condition of Items</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Exchanged items must be new, unworn, and returned in their original packaging.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Shipping Costs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The customer is responsible for covering the shipping costs for returning the item unless the exchange is due to an error on our part, in which case we will cover the shipping costs for sending the correct item.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Restrictions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Exchanges are not available for digital products.</li>
        </ul>
